The idea with the protolab is to incrementally build an efficient evironment enabling prototyping for the Moveability lab. This will be done in two ways: building a list of already available tools and incrementaly enhancing our capacity by buying what we lack.

First of all we need to clearly label every step and type of prototyping we need in the lab.
Then list the required equipment for each of those tasks.
Finally state the solution for each equipment.
