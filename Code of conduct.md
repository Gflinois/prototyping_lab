# 1 : General rules

## ASK IF YOU DONT KNOW

### 1.1 : Cleanliness and Organization

A clean and organized workshop is an efficient and safe workshop. If you wish to find and be able to use tools in the workshop you need to do you part in keeping it tidy and clean.

- Keep workstations clean and tidy after use.
- Dispose of waste properly.
- Return all tools and materials to their designated storage locations.
- Report when consumables' reserves are running low or, when possible, before using a large proportion of the reserves of any given consumable (Helping with keeping track of the inventory makes everyone's life better). 
### 1.2 : Respect for equipment and tools 

An improperly respected tool will break or loose function. It is faster and cheaper to maintain equipment rather to have to buy new ones. 
That being said, damaging or breaking tools happens, leaving it broken without saying anything impedes on everyone's ability to use it including yours. 

- Report any malfunctioning or damaged tools immediately.
- Report any missing tools and parts of tools (e.g.: missing bits for the screwdrivers).
- Do not remove any tool from the workshop without noticing.
- Do not borrow tools for more than the current workday.
- Return all tools and materials to their designated storage locations.
## 1.3 : Safety
**Here are only the general safety rules; for station specific see section 2.**

- Wear appropriate PPE. 
- Handle dangerous equipment with care.
- Know where the first aid kit is and how to use it.
- Take special care in storing and keeping out of touch anything dangerous (e.g.: sharp/hot objects).
- Be mindful of any fire hazards. 

Currently, we do not have any safety approval so, until addenda ar made, the following activities are prohibited:

- Cutting or sanding of fiber materials (e.g.: carbon fiber, glass fier ... )
- Working with corrosive, toxic, pyrophoric and carcinogen chemicals 
- Welding

In the meantime the first two can be done in the lightweight structure lab.


# 2 : Station specific rules

## 2.1 : 3D printing

#### 2.1.1 : Safety

 - Do not touch the hot end. Be it before ,during or after printing, without checking the temperature first.
 - Do not leave any foreign object inside of the enclosure, those machines are deceptively fast.
 - Avoid if possible the use of the plate scraper to remove prints from the buildplate.
 - Be really careful when using the scraper: never point the scraper in the direction of something you are not willing to destroy (especially fingers). 
#### 2.1.2 : Use

- Check the amount of filament left after printing, if it runs low : 
	- if you know how to change the filament do it before leaving the station it only takes a minute
	- if you do not know report it, someone will show you how
- Do not leave any foreign object inside of the enclosure, those machines are deceptively fast.
- Clean the buildplate of all residues after use.
- Throw any trash in the bin (do not leave anything in the small compartments inside the enclosure).
- Report any need for new materials.
- If any material other than PLA is used, load it in the left extruder, notify it and leave a post-it note on the left filament door with the following :
	- Type of material
	- Recommended printing temperature

## 2.2 : Sewing
#### 2.2.1 : Safety

- Keep hands clear of the needle when the machine is in operation.
- Turn off the machine when making adjustments or changing needles.
- Unplug the machine after use 
#### 2.2.2 : Use

- Test-run the machine with scrap material before sewing final pieces.
- Do not force fabric through the machine; let the feed dogs guide it naturally.
- Report any wear or dullness in needles or other components.

## 2.3 : Mechanical assembly and modification
#### 2.3.1 : Safety
- Secure all materials properly using clamps or vices before working on them.
- Wear safety goggles when cutting, drilling, or grinding.
- Do **not** were gloves or scarves when using powertools
- Disconnect equipment from power sources when changing attachments or performing maintenance.
#### 2.3.2 : Use
- Only use tools in an evironment devoid of mess
- Ensure that all tools are fit for the task before starting work.
- Put the bits back in their **Designated** place. Searching for a specific size of driver should be easy, not a pain.
- If anything does not have a clear enough designated pace report it. 
- Maintain clear communication with others working nearby to avoid accidental interference.
- Quickly wipe the surface after use.
## 2.4 : Electronics
#### 2.4.1 : Safety
- Never handle live circuits without proper training and safety measures.
- Do not handle high currents and tensions without the proper additional training and safety measures.
- Keep liquids away from electronic stations to prevent short circuits.
- Take great precaution when using batteries, especially LiPo. If you are not sure to know what the needed precautions are, **DO NOT** use batteries before asking.
- Isolate you circuits when done.
- Do not touch a circuit. Live or not.
#### 2.4.2 : Use

- Power down all equipment after use.
- Report any damaged or malfunctioning components immediately.
- Clean the tip of the soldering iron after use.
- Be mindful of the current and tension you are subjecting any equipment to. Electronic equipment tends to be fragile and expensive.
- Be especially mindful when putting back electronic component to put them back in their designated spot. Any misplaced component can often be considered basically trash and can destroy someone's prototype if used instead of the correct one...
