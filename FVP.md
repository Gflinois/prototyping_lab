# First Viable Product 

The idea is to make anything that works.
It is the first step of any prototyping. 
In this phase of the project the focus should be to:
- streamline as much as possible the process of going from an idea to a thing
- have tools to easily test the behaviour of our thing and debug it

Every FVP needs to be easily modifiable, if it is not then it hasn't been made with the right state of mind. FVPs will break, look terrible, be overcomplicated and barely do the job.

### sensors
- tensile sensor
- pressure sensor
- distance sensor (ex sound based easier)
- imus

### actuators
- basic dc
